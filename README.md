# AVR Drivers and Projects Journey

Welcome to the AVR Drivers and Projects Journey.  
This repository is designed to help you learn AVR embedded systems in a clean, structured, and practical way.

The focus here is on building a strong foundation using reusable drivers, then applying them in real embedded applications step by step.

---

## Drivers Layer

All applications in this repository are built on top of clean, reusable, and modular drivers written in Embedded C.

Drivers included:
- GPIO Driver  
- Timer Driver  
- UART Driver  
- ADC Driver  

Each driver is implemented following embedded systems best practices, with a clear separation between hardware abstraction and application logic.

---

## Projects Structure

The projects are organized by difficulty level to ensure smooth learning progress.

Beginner level focuses on understanding peripherals and basic control logic.  
Intermediate level introduces communication and multi-module interaction.  
Advanced level focuses on full system integration and decision-making.

This progression helps you move from simple concepts to real embedded system thinking.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with the Drivers folder  
2. Study each driver carefully  
3. Test drivers individually  
4. Move to application-level projects  
5. Modify, experiment, and rebuild  

Learning embedded systems comes from practice and exploration.
