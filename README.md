## 🧩 Drivers Layer (Core Foundation)

All projects depend on reusable, clean, and modular drivers:

- 🔌 **GPIO Driver**
- ⏱ **Timer Driver**
- 📡 **UART Driver**
- 🎛 **ADC Driver**

> Drivers are written in **Embedded C**, following best practices and avoiding application-level logic inside drivers.
